Everything is W.I.P (Work In Progress). So please, consider that this isn't the final product and this readme is very incomplete! By the way,
I'll be very happy if you help with your feedback and if so, please, consider to make a 'pull request' here. 
If you have find any bug, problem, please consider to 'issue' it to me on this Github project.

The goal of the current test (0.2.3) is:

#### To test

To test, you first need to download the project, see on the header of this readme the most recent version of the 'test', then search for this 
folder and download it (or you can just download everthing).

Extract on some folder and things must show up as this image:

So, you just need to test as you already now (rpg maker mv users)

#### Map Test

To test how things goes in real in-game, look at the settings of the Plugin Manager (you just need to turn-off the 'haya-map-editor'):
